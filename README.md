# C-sharp-calculator
My first project in .NET â€” a simple C# console calculator using switch statements. It performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) based on user input. A great starting point in my C# learning journey. Built by Saif Abbas.

This is the first project I built during my journey into .NET development. It's a fully functional calculator built using C# and basic control structures such as switch statements.

The program allows the user to:

Enter two numbers

Choose an operation: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division

View the result immediately in the console

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Data types and input handling

Switch-case logic

Basic arithmetic operations in C#

Console interaction
